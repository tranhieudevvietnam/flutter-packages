## [4.0.0] - 10/09/22

* flutter_map v3. Thanks to [MooNag](https://github.com/MooNag) for the contribution!

## [3.2.0] - 28/07/22

* Support flutter_map v2.

## [3.1.0+1] - 27/06/22

* Improve the example for showing popups over the map.

## [3.1.0] - 27/06/22

* A new selectedMarkerBuilder option allows you to give selected Markers a
  different appearance/behaviour.

## [3.0.0] - 26/06/22

* Allow popups to be shown outside of the map if desired. A new example has
  been added demonstrating how this works.

## [2.2.1] - 10/06/22

* Fix a bug where the visible popup would disappear on rebuild if no
  PopupController was specified.

## [2.2.0] - 08/06/22

* Upgrade flutter_map dependency to 1.0.0. This is not backwards compatible due
  to a breaking change in the map movement stream which plugins rely on.

## [2.1.2] - 11/02/22

* Fix a bug where the map would jump around when centering on a Marker if another Marker was tapped
  before the centering finished.

## [2.1.1+1] - 11/02/22

* Fix example, the flutter_map onTap required an extra argument.

## [2.1.1] - 12/01/22

* Set onPopupEvent as an optional parameter for the PopupLayer otherwise a warning is generated when
  it is used by `flutter_map_marker_cluster`.

## [2.1.0] - 12/01/22

* Add the onPopupEvent callback.

## [2.0.1] - 31/10/21

* Fix a bug where popup showing/hiding might get stuck if a PopupController was not provided and the
  popup container layer changed position in the widget tree.

## [2.0.0] - 23/09/21

* Support multiple visible popups at once. The default behaviour remains single-popup but some
  breaking changes in PopupController were required:

    - hidePopups -> hideAllPopups
    - hidePopupIfShowingFor -> hidePopupsOnlyFor
    - showPopup -> showPopupsOnlyFor

  If you wish to show multiple popups at once you will want to change the default MarkerTapBehavior,
  see the documentation in PopupMarkerLayerOptions.

## [1.0.1] - 27/08/21

* Add an option to center the map on the marker when showing the popup.

## [1.0.0+2] - 04/07/21

* Add simple example.
* Remove pedantic lints in favour of flutter's built in lints.

## [1.0.0+1] - 11/06/21

* Add updated demo gif.

## [1.0.0] - 07/06/21

* Null safe
* Support rotation
* Many fixes and some extra control over the visible popup via PopupController

## [0.3.0] - 17/05/21

* PopupMarkerPlugin is removed and PopupMarkerPluginWidget is added. This plugin should now be added
  to FlutterMap as one of the 'children' instead of being added as a plugin.
* Showing/hiding of popups can now use a fade animation with a customisable duration and curve.
* Removed deprecated PopupSnap values, they have been replaced as follows:
    * left -> markerLeft
    * top -> markerTop
    * right -> markerRight
    * bottom -> markerBottom

## [0.2.1] - 05/03/21

* Move demo gif to separate repo so that the gif is not included when downloading this package.
* Updated demo gif to show new snapping behaviour.
* Added some thanks and links to related repos in READEME.md.
* Add documentation to make pub.dev happy.
* Add trailing newline to PopupSnap to make pub.dev happy.

## [0.2.0] - 18/02/21

* New dialog-snapping options added. Can now be snapped to the map rather than just the marker. Old
  marker snapping options have been deprecated in favour of more specific enums, so `left` now
  becomes `markerLeft` etc.

## [0.1.4] - 23/04/20

* Fix bug where the popup state did not change when selected another marker when the popup was
  already showing.
* Add showPopupFor(Marker) method to PopupController if the user wants plain show behaviour instead
  of toggle behaviour.

## [0.1.3] - 22/04/20

* Move `PopupBuilder` to its own file and export it in `extension_api.dart` so that it can be used
  without having to import the layer options.

## [0.1.2] - 22/04/20

* Possible to hide any of a list of markers. If the popup is showing for any of the provided markers
  it will be hidden. Otherwise nothing happens.
* Added `extension_api.dart` to be imported by plugins extending this one. This is initially
  for `flutter_map_marker_cluster`.

## [0.1.1] - 20/04/20

* Add example gif

## [0.1.0] - 20/04/20

* Complete rewrite. Now PopupMarkerLayer is a replacement for MarkerLayer and is not compatible with
  the clustering plugin. Popups for the clustering plugin will be proposed via PR on the marker
  clustering project.

## [0.0.3] - 17/04/20

* More detailed description
* Improve README.md

## [0.0.2] - 17/04/20
