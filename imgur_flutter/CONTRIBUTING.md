# Contributing to project

## Found an Issue ?

If you found a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation you can help by submitting an issue to the
project issues [page](https://github.com/ShellBear/imgur.dart/issues/new/choose).

Even better you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

## Styling your contributions

This module use Dart as a primary language. This repository follows the
[Dart code style](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style).
A good practice is to use [dartfmt](https://dart.dev/tools/dartfmt) to format your code before pushing any modification
and to run [dartanalyzer](https://dart.dev/tools/dartanalyzer) in parallel to perform a static analysis on your code.

## Submitting issues and/or pull requests

There are templates available to submit a bug report or feature request. It's better to use them, but if it does not
fit your needs, you can create a [regular issue](https://github.com/ShellBear/imgur.dart/issues/new).
